**A mobile app to reward customers for scanning QR and barcodes on Indomie products.**

## 📱 What is Indomie Airdrop?

Indomie Airdrop is a mobile app that allows users to earn tokens by scanning the QR or barcode on their Indomie packs. Each scan rewards them with tokens, based on the product type and size. The more products they scan, the more tokens they accumulate.

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Download the App**
2. **Sign Up / Login**
3. **Scan Indomie QR or Barcode**
4. **Earn Tokens Instantly**
5. **Track Tokens in Wallet**
6. **Redeem or Use Later**

## 💰 How Are Tokens Funded?

The app will display **limited ads** featuring products from **Tolaram-owned brands** (like Indomie, Dano, Lush hair, Addme, etc.). Revenue from these ads will fund the tokens given to users. This ensures a sustainable reward system while promoting other Tolaram products.

## 📈 Why Start With Indomie?

Indomie is a widely consumed, daily food product with a large and loyal fanbase. By launching with Indomie, we are tapping into a market that already has a strong connection to the brand. This project will drive increased sales, as customers can now "mine" tokens with every pack they buy, turning an everyday purchase into a rewarding experience. As the program grows, we can extend it to other Tolaram products, building even greater engagement across the brand family.
